You have to have a valid XulRunner installation to run the launcher.

It is being developed for xr1.9.

So you can ge the nightly build of xr1.9pre from this url:

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/nightly/latest-trunk/

You can google for the official 1.8 release as it works fine there so far.

Note: XML Templates were added in ff3 so they may not work in all 1.8 releases...

You can unzip xulrunner archive to anywhere you want and install it using the following two options:

--register-user
--register-global

The first one installs to a user's profile directory.

The second installs to a system wide location (you must have rights to do this).

Example:

./xulrunner --register-user

Once you do then this version of xulrunner will be registered and you can simply execute the launcher via it's stub file.

Example:

./launcher
./launcher.exe

To create a stub file simply copy xulrunner-stub to the launcher directory and rename it to launcher[.exe]... 

If you want you can also launch the program directly like so:

./xulrunner ./path/to/launcher/application.ini
